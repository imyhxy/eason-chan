# [What a Wonderful World - 2007 Live](https://music.163.com/song?id=65193)

* 作词：George Weiss
* 作曲：Robert Thiele
* I see trees of green
* red roses too
* I see them bloom
* for me and you
* And I think to myself
* what a wonderful world.
* I see skies of blue
* and clouds of white
* The bright blessed day'
* the dark sacred night
* And I think to myself
* what a wonderful world.
* The colors of the rainbow
* so pretty in the sky
* Are also on the faces
* of people going by
* I see friends shaking hands
* saying how do you do “
* They're really saying I love you.
* I hear babies cry'
* I watch them grow
* They'll learn much more
* than I'll ever know
* And I think to myself
* what a wonderful world
*
