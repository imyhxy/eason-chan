* Because you're good to me, babe, i know.
* That you're up to something and i don't like it.
* Because you're good to me, babe, i know.
* You're no good.
* It's no good to be in love with you again.
* 
* 当时分手之后,
* 多么心痛.
* 你却还能够说,
* 都是我的错.
* 之后你打电话,
* 说你很寂寞,
* 一直想念我,
* 是否还能做个朋友.
* No baby, no baby,请你别再靠近我.
* No baby, no baby,你没那么的保守.
* No baby, no baby,别到现在才来对我说,
* 你后悔了.
* And ask me for more.

* 
* 昨晚跟好朋友,
* 开个party,
* 怎么都没想到,
* 会再见到你.
* 你的甜言蜜语,
* 让我佩服到底.
* 谁在谁怀里,
* 爱谁不过是个骗局.
* No baby, no baby,请你别再靠近我.
* No baby, no baby,你没那么的保守.

* 你后悔了.
