* 作词：林嘉欣
* 作曲：林伟哲
* Hey, you once called me your baby
* say it for the last time
* with all your strength and meaning it this time
* Hey, you once promised me the world
* but I never asked for it
* but I never asked for it
* Hey, you once praised me beautiful
* 
* why I`d get get weaker
* why would I get weaker
* oh Please, please don`t,
* I am so scared, scared you`re too perfect for me
* or am I too naive for you
* 
* either way it`s too late
* too late for regrets, I`m hurrrrrrt
* leave me out of love
* leave love out, leave me out
* 
* hey, let`s just pretend
* nothing ever happened
* nothing ever happened
* hey, let`s just pretend
* nothing ever happened
* nothing nothing never ever happened
*
