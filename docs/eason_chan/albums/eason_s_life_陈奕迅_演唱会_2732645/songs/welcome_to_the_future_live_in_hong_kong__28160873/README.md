* We ride the wings of time
* 
* To our future we will fly
* 
* Higher and higher now
* 
* Our love take us higher now
* 
* Fly....
* 
* Dreaming....
* 
* Waking....
* 
* Higher now....
* 
* We ride the wings of time
* 
* To our future we will fly
* Higher and higher now
* 
* Our love take us higher now
* 
* Close your eyes
* 
* Fly with me
