# [The End of the World (Live)](https://music.163.com/song?id=64583)

* Why does the sun go on shining
* Why does the sea rush to shore
* Don't they know it's the end of the world
* Cause you don't love me anymore
* Why do the birds go on singing
* Why do the stars glow above
* Don't they know it's the end of the world
* It ended when I lost your love
* I wake up in the morning and I wonder
* why everything's the same as it was
* I can't understand
* No I can't understand
* how life goes on the way it does
* Why does my heart go on beating
* Why do these eyes of mine cry
* Don't they know it's the end of the world
* It ended when you said goodbye
*
