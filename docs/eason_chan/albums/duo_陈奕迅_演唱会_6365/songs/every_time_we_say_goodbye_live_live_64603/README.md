# [Every Time We Say Goodbye(Live) - live](https://music.163.com/song?id=64603)

* Every time we say goodbye
* I die a little
* Every time we say goodbye
* I wonder why a little
* While clouds above me
* Who must be in the know
* Think so little of me
* They allow you to go
* When you're near
* There's such an air
* Of spring about it
* I can hear a lark somewhere
* Begin to sing about it
* There's no love song final
* But how strange to change
* From major to minor
* Every time we say goodbye
