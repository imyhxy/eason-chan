* While this Christmas
* I am falling like snowflakes at your door
* As my guardian angel's singing for someone else
* Eternity stains when love has turned into pain
* love must be something I don′t deserve
* This is my private Christmas Song
* 
* All the memories are fading
* Snow turns to rain
* As tonight I am craving for those endless kisses
* A melody written for someone
* just as a child has its parents
* This song is something you never care for
* This is my Private Christmas song
* This is my Private Christmas Song
