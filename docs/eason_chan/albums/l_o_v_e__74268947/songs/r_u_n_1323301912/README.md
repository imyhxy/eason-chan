* 作词：岑宁儿
* 作曲：岑宁儿
* Last night I had a dream
* That I was on an endless run
* I wasn’t tired I wasn’t scared
* I couldn’t stop but I didn’t care
* I ran through the night I ran thru the rain
* I ran and ran till everything looked the same
* And it was then I passed the lake
* at your reflection I turned to ask
* Can anyone tell
* That I am lost
* Can anyone tell
* That I am naked before you
* That I am burning for you
* So there you were and I knew it was over
* however beautiful however mad
* before I wake I just had to ask
* Do you remember why you’re here
* Do you remember what
* what in the world were you after
* or were you running away somehow
* I woke up both happy and sad
* A little sorry a little glad
*
