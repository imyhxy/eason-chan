# [Sleep Alone](https://music.163.com/song?id=36539010)

* 作词：Stephen Mok
* 作曲：Michael Lai/Victor Tse
* Thousands of cities from home
* Wander into the unknown
* Chances are here I was told
* Crossing the footsteps of new and of old
* Recurring smiles in the air
* Sky blue and life full of cheer
* Stories of people unfold
* And all we'd imagined is here
* Travel on into the dawn
* Where memories grow
* Sway along with all the names
* That this life may hold
* It's the little things little things
* Laugh through the night
* Through the crowd
* Till the end of the road
* Travel on beyond the dawn
* Where everyone knows
* Faces familiar
* A place I'd call home
* If there's anything anything
* I'd ask about in the end
* Where will I wake up tomorrow
* Travel on into the dawn
* Where memories grow
* Sway along with all the names
* That this life may hold
* It's the little things little things
* Laugh through the night
* Through the crowd
* Till the end of the road
* Travel on beyond the dawn
* Where everyone knows
* Faces familiar
* A place I'd call home
* If there's anything anything
* I'd ask about in the end
* Where will I wake up tomorrow
