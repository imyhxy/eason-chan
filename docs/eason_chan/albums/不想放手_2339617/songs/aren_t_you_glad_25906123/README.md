* 作词：Russell Harris
* 作曲：Russell Harris
* Aren't you glad  you didn't stay with me.
* Bohemian life and instability.
* You went off to university.
* And you took your love away from me.
* Endless nights lovers friends and fun,
* Big-City lights,your new life had begun.
* And as the world turns on and on,
* Love is lost and love is won,
* laughed and cried when we were young,
* You went your own way, I survived
* And did you ever see everything inside of me?
* So now you live your life in luxury.
* Double glazing.turbo washing machine.
* And your fiance is boring as hell.
* You never laugh.you're both professional.
* You know that film.that I'd started to write?
* It's a box-office smash
* and I'm on the next flight to get award on TV tonight
* Looking back.I think I've done alright.
* And as the world turns on and on,
* Love is lost and love is won,
* laughed and cried when we were young
* You went your own way, I survived.
* And did you ever see everything inside of me?
* And as the world turns on and on,
* Love is lost and love is won.
* laughed and cried when we were young,
* You went your own way,I survived.
* And did you ever see everything inside of me?
* Oh,aren't you glad you didn't stay with me
* Oh,aren't you glad you didn't stay with me?
* Oh, aren't you glad you didn't stay with me?
* You didn't want my love,
* So aren't you gald,
* Aren't you glad,aren't you glad.
* Aren't you glad aren't you glad
* Aren't you glad,aren't you glad.
*
