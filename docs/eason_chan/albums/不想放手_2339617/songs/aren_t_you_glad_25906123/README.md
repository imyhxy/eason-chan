* Aren't you glad  you didn't stay with me.
* Bohemian life and instability.
* You went off to university.
* And you took your love away from me.
* Endless nights lovers friends and fun,
* Big-City lights,your new life had begun.
* And as the world turns on and on,
* Love is lost and love is won,
* laughed and cried when we were young,
* You went your own way, I survived
* And did you ever see everything inside of me?
* So now you live your life in luxury.
* Double glazing.turbo washing machine.
* And your fiance is boring as hell.
* You never laugh.you're both professional.
* You know that film.that I'd started to write?
* It's a box-office smash
* and I'm on the next flight to get award on TV tonight
* Looking back.I think I've done alright.
* And as the world turns on and on,
* Love is lost and love is won,
* laughed and cried when we were young
* You went your own way, I survived.
* And did you ever see everything inside of me?
* And as the world turns on and on,
* Love is lost and love is won.
* laughed and cried when we were young,
* You went your own way,I survived.
* And did you ever see everything inside of me?
* Oh,aren't you glad you didn't stay with me
* Oh,aren't you glad you didn't stay with me?
* Oh, aren't you glad you didn't stay with me?
* You didn't want my love,
* So aren't you gald,
* Aren't you glad,aren't you glad.
* Aren't you glad aren't you glad
* Aren't you glad,aren't you glad.

1. **[Nfa_young \[881\]](https://music.163.com/#/user/home?id=36829217):** 四年前用做铃声，找了四年没找到。就在刚刚，我哼给她听，她一下子就感觉是这首，于是我找到了。开始相信缘分。

2. **[CaliforniiaBoy \[727\]](https://music.163.com/#/user/home?id=39916922):** 本来《Aren't You Glad》是由英国音乐人Russell Harris一手包办作曲与填词的歌曲，被陈奕迅采用后由林夕写上国语歌词；但由于陈奕迅认为原装的英文歌词较能表达出反讽的意味，于是决定采用英文歌词录音，成为其加入乐坛以来第一首英文单曲。

3. **[甜甜和念 \[540\]](https://music.163.com/#/user/home?id=64157771):** 其实陈奕迅除了音乐上的天赋，语言天赋也很高，无论综艺节目模仿意大利歌剧，还是果粒橙各地方言版的广告，各地方的盆友听到自己本地方言，都会由衷赞叹。

4. **[Nfa_young \[358\]](https://music.163.com/#/user/home?id=36829217):** 谢谢大家的点赞，我们还在一起，希望点赞的大家也都能够收获幸福。
