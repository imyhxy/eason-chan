# [Somethin' Stupid (Live) - live](https://music.163.com/song?id=67141)

* [by:渺渺兮予怀-]
* I know I stand in line,
* Until you think you have the time
* To spend an evening with me
* And if we go some place to dance
* I know that there's a chance
* You won't be leaving with me
* And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
* And have a drink or two
* And then I go and spoil it all
* By saying something stupid
* Like: "I love you"
* I can see it in your eyes
* That you despise the same old lines
* You heard the night before
* And though it's just a line to you
* For me it's true
* It never seemed so right before
* I practice every day
* To find some clever lines to say
* To make the meaning come true
* But then I think I'll wait
* Until the evening gets late
* That I'm alone with you
* The time is right
* Your perfume fills my head
* The stars get red
* And oh, the night's so blue
* And then I go and spoil it all
* By saying something stupid
* Like: "I love you"
* The time is right
* Your perfume fills my head
* The stars get red
* And oh, the night's so blue
* And then I go and spoil it all
* By saying something stupid
* Like: "I love you"
* "I love you"
* "I love you"
* "I love you"
